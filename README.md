# Studio-Lab-Healthcare-Ellinger

# Med Loc Location
The main application is currently being hosted on Heroku and is still under development

This github repository contains the developent of a Dashboard developed by a group of students at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC)
for the course Studio Lab II -Design Computation - ARCH 7212 - 002
under the direction of professor Jefferson Ellinger and Dr. Alireza Karduni

# Data Pipeline
Inside the data pipeline folder you will find the data sets originally used in this project
alonside a sets of notebook files from some of the techniques applied to either manage the data
apply machine learning algorithms or create the meta data set

# Flask API
We created and API framework using Flask in Python for the main dashboard
Inside this folder you will find some of the initial documentation for the
creation of this API. 
For the final, polished version of this I would suggest looking into the following githuib repository; https://github.com/Fclaudio/MedLoc-Heroku-API

# Machine Learning
Inside this folder there are some notebook files from some of the inital testing 
to use different machine learning algorithms with our data set in order to generate 
and uncover unusal relationships between the information being gathered.
